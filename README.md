# Course-checker
This project is a Python automation script that monitors course seat availability on Polytechnique Montréal’s student portal (Dossier Étudiant) and sends real-time notifications to a Discord server when seats become available.  It combines web scraping / HTTP requests, session authentication, asynchronous execution, and Discord bot integration.
